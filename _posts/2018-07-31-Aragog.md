Today we will start a new thread of Hack the Box writeups. For those who doesn't know what it is, [Hack the Box](https://www.hackthebox.eu/) is a web page that publish vulnerable machines and other CTFs challenges to practice pentesting and security skills.

Spoiler: in this first Hack the Box machine we will have to gain acces by reading system files using an XXE vulnerability and elevate privileges intercepting the requests from the administrator.

### Information gathering

Starting as allways, we first use **nmap** to analyze the public services. As we can see in the output, the machine only have the 3 most common ports.

**nmap** with *-sC* option also launches the default NSE scripts, and one of these checks the authentication with the anonymous user in the FTP server. In the FTP service we only see one file with XML content related with network masks.

The web service only have the default webpage for the Apache server. With **dirb** we will enumerate one more file in the web server (it's important to use *-X* option to specify some common web extencions, otherwise it won't find anything.

### First step to the machine

When we use the new web functionallity it returns the maximum number of hosts in a IPv4 network (2^32). We can try to use the XML file downloaded form the FTP service to test if the web server accepts XML content. Voil√†, the web page responds with the number of hosts in a 26 bits network mask.

But what we can do now with this functionallify? Well, we can try to generate a Data Type Definition (DTD) and use XXE vulnerability. In the example we use the foo DTD with the xxe element, that is the responsable to make a request to our host.

Once we know that the web server is vulnerable to XXE, we can now read local files (LFI) to search some way to enter in the machine. For example with the next request we can read the */etc/passwd* file and know the available users in the machine.

Searching some sensitive files and services configurations, we finally found that the *florian* user have available the SSH RSA key. Now with these information make the first step forward and tenter in the machine using SSH.

### Unconventional privilege elevation

Now that we entered in the machine it's time to think how to elevate privileges. Once tested the most common vulnerabilities (configuration errors, vulnerable services, ...), the soluction must be unconventional. Searching for all the files that can modify the current user, we found at */var/www/html/* a web page owned by *Cliff*.

Looking at the *dev_wiki* directory, we can see that this new web page is a Wordpress blog. Wordpress uses *wp-config.php* file to store sensitive information like the databese credentials. Maybe the database contains more unprotected credentials to elevate privileges.

The *wp_wiki* database contains the Administrator password protected using the Portable PHP password hashing framework. We will continue looking for some entry points, but in background we will execute a [script](https://github.com/micahflee/phpass_crack) that brute force to the administrator password.

The web page it seems a normal blog with static content. It also have available the Wordpress typical pages, with the *wp-login.php* we can launch **hydra** to burteforce the administrator user in background like the password cracker.

![](/images/posts/Aragog/img17.png "Wordpress admin login")

But navigating for the web we can see a message from Cliff (the owner of the web) to Florian that says he will be loggin regulary to the web page. These is the clue that we are looking for! If Cliff is logging with the administrator user, we can intercept the password in clear text.

![](/images/posts/Aragog/img18.png "Blog entry")

We can do it by intercepting the communications or modifiyng the *wp-login.php* (remember that we have write privileges) and log the password when some user make a request. The second aproach is easyer and it only requires 6 lines of PHP at the beggining of the *wp-login.php* to colect the credentials and write in some temporal file.

![](/images/posts/Aragog/img19.png "Web code modifyed")

We only have to wait some minutes and Cliff automatically logs in the page nad the temporal file is generated. Now we can see that it would have been impossible to discover the password using brute force.

The last try is to check if the user Cliff reuses the administrator password for the Wordpress blog in the machine.
