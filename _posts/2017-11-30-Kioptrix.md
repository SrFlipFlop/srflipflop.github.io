~~Hello world!~~

The first post of this blog will be about a vulnerable virtual machine that a colleague of work recommend me to practice different pentest skills. In this type of blog I will try to show the process that I use to solve these type of vulnerable machines. Because I think that a picture is worth than a thousand words, I will use images and a few words to descrive the pentest.

You can not start a blog without using a phrase from Sun Tzu, the most appropriate for this case is: *"If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles"*. This means that the most important thing to solve these type of challenges is the information that you have. Any type of information could help in a different stage of the challenge, so it's important to save the tools log or write the information in a notebook.

>* Launch **nmap** to discover which public services are running in the vulnerable machine.

>* Analyzing the web pages, a priori does not seem to contain anything strange. One have a default content for a web server, and the other doesn't allow us to view the content. But looking more closely at the normal web page, we discover a web comment that contains an URL.
