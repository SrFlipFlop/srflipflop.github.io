Hello world!

The first post of this blog will be about a vulnerable virtual machine that a colleague of work recommend me to practice different pentest skills. In this type of blog I will try to show the process that I use to solve this type of vulnerable machine. Because I think that a picture is worth a thousand words, I will use images and a few words to descrive the pentest.
