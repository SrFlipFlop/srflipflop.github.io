I think many cybersecurity enthusiasts have encountered the same problem throughout their careers: **to keep learning at the same pace as the industry is advancing** (*and let's not talk about different computer-related ramifications such as artificial intelligence, robotics, telecommunications, new language development, etc.*).

Over the years I've tried many different options for keeping my notes, from local options like *CherryTree*/*Obsidian* to cloud solutions like *Google Drive*/*GitBook*. Each option has its pros and cons, but as much as you can keep your knowledge well structured, it is still difficult to keep learning at such a fast pace (**and above all to be able to use that knowledge when you need it**).

*Obsidian* is a good option since it allows you to create tags and indexes to search for information. But what better than to complicate your life a little and create a custom solution to learn a little in the process? :)
