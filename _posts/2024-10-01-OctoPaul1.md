I think many cybersecurity enthusiasts have encountered the same problem throughout their careers: **to keep learning at the same pace as the industry is advancing** (*and let's not talk about different computer-related ramifications such as artificial intelligence, robotics, telecommunications, new language development, etc.*).

Over the years I've tried many different options for keeping my notes, from local options like *CherryTree*/*Obsidian* to cloud solutions like *Google Drive*/*GitBook*. Each option has its pros and cons, but as much as you can keep your knowledge well structured, it is still difficult to keep learning at such a fast pace (**and above all to be able to use that knowledge when you need it**).

*Obsidian* is a good option since it allows you to create tags and indexes to search for information. But what better than to complicate your life a little and create a custom solution to learn a little in the process? :)

Given that LLMs have been improving for some time now and have been available to the public, I think it is a good moment to experiment with this type of technologies to reduce our day-to-day workload. OctoPaul is a project that aims to analyze different types of content (videos, blog posts, Twitter threads, newsletters, ...) to summarize and tag the information.

Analyzing the current state of the art, I couldn't overlook the great work that **Daniel Miessler** is doing in this field. I had been following his [newsletter](https://danielmiessler.com/) for a while, but every time I see more of his content it helps me a lot to guide me for this project. More specifically, his project [*fabric*](https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric) is what any <del>scriptkiddie</del> begginer wanted to have. In short, this project allows the use of a large number of prompts/patterns already refined by experts in this field.

In order to not to complicate my life <del>so much</del>, I'm going to start using *fabric* manually to test how it works, how analyzes different types of content, how it handles the inpunts/outputs, and finally how to interact with those functionallities programatically.

Let's start by analyzing one of the most interesting parts of Fabric, the large number of prompts/patterns created and debugged by the community. In the following image we can see that there are very long patterns that allow us to create regular expressions, improve other prompts, parse JSON files or even create Nuclei templates.
