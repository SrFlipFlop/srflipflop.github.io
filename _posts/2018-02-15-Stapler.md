### Information gathering

Starting as always, we use **nmap** to enumarete the services in the machine. In the first image the **nmap** use some scripts and the agresive mode to enumerate better the vulnerable machine, and the second image enumerate the avaliable services in the machine.

### Searching the entry points

Since we don't identify any vulnerable services with this information, it's time to start testing each service. The **nmap** report show us that the FTP protocol allow us to use an anonymous user, but once in the machine only allows to list the current directory and download the content.

The first website seems to be an empty directory listing (possible for a file upload vulnerabiliti).
