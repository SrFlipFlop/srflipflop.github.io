### Information gathering

Starting as always, we use **nmap** to enumarete the services in the machine. In the first image the **nmap** use some scripts and the agresive mode to enumerate better the vulnerable machine, and the second image enumerate the avaliable services in the machine.

### Searching the entry points

Since we don't identify any vulnerable services with this information, it's time to start testing each service. The **nmap** report show us that the FTP protocol allow us to use an anonymous user, but once in the machine only allows to list the current directory and download the content.

The first website seems to be an empty directory listing (possible for a file upload vulnerabiliti). The second website have more content, but is only a landing page.

![](/images/posts/Stapler/img5.png "Second website")

We use **nikto** to recolect more information about the second webpage and enumerate some directories. The tool reported two interesting directories in the *robots.txt* file.

![](/images/posts/Stapler/img7.png "Robots.txt")

The first directory in the *robots.txt* it's only a XSS trap. The second is a new webpage that contains a blog. To recolect more information about the new website, we use **dirb** to enumerate new directories.

![](/images/posts/Stapler/img9.png "Blog")

![](/images/posts/Stapler/img10.png "Dirb")

The **dirb** has discovered that the blog website uses *Wordpress* to manage the content. Now we can use **WPScan** to extract information about the CMS version and enumerate the avaliable plugins.

![](/images/posts/Stapler/img12.png "WPScan 2")

Once we recolected the information it's time to search for some vulnerabilitie that allow us to gain remote access. Like many other times, we use **searchsploit** to search for vulnerabilities in the differents Wordpress plugins.
