This second VulnHub machine has certain complications to get the first shell with user privileges. The elevation of privileges has no mystery and you just have to enumerate it correctly.

### Information gathering

Starting as always, we use **nmap** to enumarete the services in the machine. In the first image the **nmap** use some scripts and the agresive mode to enumerate better the vulnerable machine, and the second image enumerate the avaliable services in the machine.

### Searching the entry points

Since we don't identify any vulnerable services with this information, it's time to start testing each service. The **nmap** report show us that the FTP protocol allow us to use an anonymous user, but once in the machine only allows to list the current directory and download the content.

The first website seems to be an empty directory listing (possible for a file upload vulnerabiliti). The second website have more content, but is only a landing page.

We use **nikto** to recolect more information about the second webpage and enumerate some directories. The tool reported two interesting directories in the *robots.txt* file.

The first directory in the *robots.txt* it's only a XSS trap. The second is a new webpage that contains a blog. To recolect more information about the new website, we use **dirb** to enumerate new directories.

![](/images/posts/Stapler/img9.png "Blog")

The **dirb** has discovered that the blog website uses *Wordpress* to manage the content. Now we can use **WPScan** to extract information about the CMS version and enumerate the avaliable plugins.

Once we recolected the information it's time to search for some vulnerabilitie that allow us to gain remote access. Like many other times, we use **searchsploit** to search for vulnerabilities in the differents Wordpress plugins.

To exploit the Local File Inclusion vulnerability we can use the proof of concept in the python code. We just need to modify the random number and put the path we want to read (in this case the *wp-config.php*). Once used the exploited de LFI, the website return a default error mesage and a new blog post is generated.  These blogs contain image names that can be found in the Wordpress path */wp-content/uploads*.

![](/images/posts/Stapler/img17.png "Images uploaded")

![](/images/posts/Stapler/img18.png "Configuration file")

### First shell with user privileges

With the password in the *wp-config.php* and the multiple user names found in different comments, we can try to do a brute-force attack to the SSH server. **Hydra** discovers that the user *zoe* have the password *plbkac*, now we can enter to the sistem to elevate privileges.

### Privilege elevation

The final step to elevate privileges using the user *zoe* require to obtain more information about the operative system, the services and the configuration files. In this case searching the OS and the kernel versions with **searchsploit** or our friend Google we can obtain a privilage escalation exploit. Then we have to transfer the exploit using **scp** and execute it.
