~~Hello world!~~

The first post of this blog will be about a vulnerable virtual machine that a colleague of work recommended me to practice different pentest skills. In this type of blog I will try to show the process that I use to solve these type of vulnerable machines. Because I think that a picture is worth than a thousand words, I will use images and a few words to descrive the pentest.

You can not start a blog without using a phrase from Sun Tzu, the most appropriate for this case is: *"If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles"*. This means that the most important thing to solve these type of challenges is the information that you have. Any type of information could help in a different stage of the challenge, so it's important to save the tools log or write the information in a notebook.

### Information gathering

The first step consist in discover which public services are running in the vulnerable machine using **nmap**.

Analyzing the web pages, it doesn't seem to contain anything strange. One site havge default content for a web server, and the other doesn't allow us to view the content. But looking more closely at the normal web page, we discover a web comment that contains an URL.

Using the hidden path discovered in the source code, we have access to a example chat application that apparently don't have any vulnerability to gain a shell. Using the tool **searchsploit** (local ExploitDB database), we find that pChart have a directory traversal vulnerability.

### First step to the remote shell

This first vulnerability will not allow us to gain remote access to the server, but we can obtain sensitive information like */etc/password* file. Remembering that we have another website that forbid us to access, with the directory traversal vulnerability it s possible to obtain the Apache configuration file and discover which restriction have the server. In the configuration file you can see that the virtual host at 8080 port only allow connections using the user agent Mozilla 4.

Using **Burp suite** proxy it is possible to change automatically the user agent header and enter in the second website. Doing a brief research apparently the web application **phptax** doesn't have any web vulnerability, but searching with *searchsploit* we discover two remote code execution vulnerabilities (one of them in metasploit).

### Second step to the remote shell

With **metasploit** will be easier to gain remote access, we will only have to search for the phptax module and configure it for port 8080.

### Privileges elevation

Once we have access in the machine with a low level privilege user, it's time to search some privilege escalation exploit. Another time using **searchsploit** we find two exploits for FreeBSD 9.0. The final step to gain privileges is to transfer the exploit code. Using **nc** we can open a port in the attacker machine and wait for a connection to get the file. In the vulnerable machine we only have to compile the exploit code and execute it to gain root privileges.
