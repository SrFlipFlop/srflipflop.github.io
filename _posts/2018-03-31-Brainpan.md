### Information gathering

To enumerate the attack surface we use, as allways, **nmap**. This machine only have two open services: a login pannel and web application.

The web application only contains an image, so it's time to search some resource using **dirb**. The *bin* directory contains a *PE* file that seams to be the next step of the challange.

### Reversing the PE file 

The strings indicates that the executable is the same service at the *9999* port. The first attempt that we will try is to search the password in the PE file or the algorithm that generates it (~~spoiler: the password is in the strings~~).

The aproach to search the password is to find the function that will compare with the user input. With **radare2** we can search for the functions used like *strcmp* that probably will be used to compare the user input with the password.
With *axt* we can see where is used the *strcmp* function and analyzing the function we found that *sheetstorm* is the input for the compare.

Using the correct password the service prints the OK message but nothing more. The second path will consist in exploit the network service.

### Exploting the service

> Note: to debug the executable I will use Immunity debugger in a Windows XP.

The first step to exploit a program consists in find if the service is vulnerable to a buffer overflow. In this case we will use the tipical *A* long string.

Now to search the exact offset to overflow the buffer, we use **pattern\_create** to create a special long string. With the **pattern\_offset** now we can search for the value in the EIP register to know the correct offset. Finally with **python** we generate the string to put *B* in the EIP to confirm the offset.

Now that we control the EIP, ...
