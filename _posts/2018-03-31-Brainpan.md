The third VulnHub machine is perfect to start with the exploiting of network services. It allows you to perform all the steps to get a shell through a stack buffer overflow vulnerability. To elevate privileges you have to use a very useful trick that can be used in many different environments.

### Information gathering

To enumerate the attack surface we use (as allways) **nmap**. This machine only have two opened services: a login pannel and a web application.

The web application only contains an image, so it's time to search some extra resources using **dirb**. The discovered directory only contains a *PE* file that seams to be the next step of the challange.

### Reversing the PE file 

The strings indicates that the executable is the same service at the *9999* port. The first attempt that we will try is to search the password in the PE file or the algorithm that generates it (~~spoiler: the password is in the strings command~~).

>Note: a common strategy to reverse engineer a big program is to start with a common points (like third party libraries, strings, API connections, ...) and then just follow the white rabbit :)

In these case we will search the function used to compare the password with the user input. With **radare2** we can list the functions used in the binary, like *strcmp* that probably will be used to compare the user input.
With *axt* we can see where is used the *strcmp* and with some analysis of the function, we found that *sheetstorm* is the input for the compare.

Using the correct password the service prints the OK message but nothing more. The second path will consist in exploit the network service.

### Exploting the service

>Note: to debug the executable I will use Immunity debugger in a Windows XP.

The first step to exploit a program consists in find if the service is vulnerable to a buffer overflow. In this case we will use the tipical *A* long string. When de program recieves a log string, the debugger shows the error *"Access violation when executing [41414141]"* (*41* is the hexadecimal code for the *A* character).

![](/images/posts/Brainpan/img9.png "Overflow the service")

Now to search the exact offset to overflow the buffer, we use the script **pattern\_create** to create a special long string. With the **pattern\_offset** now we can search for the value in the EIP register to know the correct offset. Finally with **python** we generate the string to put *BBBB* (*42424242*) in the EIP to confirm the offset.

![](/images/posts/Brainpan/img11.png "Try the correct offset")

Now that we control the EIP, we need the way to insert a shellcode in the stack and redirect the program flow to the malicious code. To do it we will use some portion of code that jumps to the section that we can control with the overflow, in this case the *JMP ESP* will jump to the start of the shellcode.

![](/images/posts/Brainpan/img12.png "Search code")

To check if the current payload works properly, we will put a breakpoint in the *JMP ESP* to stop the program if programs jump to the instruction. To construct the payload we need to use the offset of *A* and the address of the jump instruction in little endian format.

![](/images/posts/Brainpan/img13.png "Trying the jump to the instruction")

Now we know that the jump works, it's time to generate the shellcode. With **metasploit** (or **msfvenom**) we create a bind shell for Windows. Then we only need to copy the shellcode to our payload and add previously a *nop sled* to increase the probability to reach our code.

Now that we got a shell in the test environment, it's time to try the exploit in the brainpan machine. Magically the exploit works in the first attempt.

The file system of the machine look souspicious, it seems more a linux file system than a windows one. As we do not find any point to elevate privileges, we will try to exploit the remote system as using a linux shellcode. To do this we only need to generate a new shellcode and change the buffer for the explotation.

![](/images/posts/Brainpan/img18.png "Generate new shellcode")

Now that we have a shell in the linux enviroment, it's time to search for some explotation vulnerability or a missconfiguration. With *sudo -l* we can list the *sudo* configuration, in this case we see the script */home/anansi/bin/anansi_util* can be executed without password.

![](/images/posts/Brainpan/img19.png "Linux shell in the system")

Playing with the script options we can see that with the *manual* option it is possible to launch a **man** for the specified binary. **man** contain different miscellaneous commands that allows the execution of shell commads. In this case if we use *!/bash/sh* in the man options, it will spawn a shell for the root user.
