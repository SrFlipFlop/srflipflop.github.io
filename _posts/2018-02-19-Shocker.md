In this first HackTheBox machine classified as for beginners, we will follow the [KISS principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) (*Keep it simple, __stupid!__*) to achieve remote code execution and subsequent privilege escalation.

### Information gathering

The first step is to know which services are running on the machine, so we are going to use *nmap* with the `-A` option to scan the services versions and the `-sC` option to use the default NSE scripts.

On the machine we found a web application on port 80 and an SSH server on an unconventional port. First we are going to try to exploit the application, but when we enter the web page we can see that it only contains an image.

In order to investigate the application a little more, we are going to bruteforce some popular directories in case there are any hidden ones that cannot be accessed from the web page. For that we are going to use *dirb* with the default dictionary, while we analyze if the **Apache** server version may be vulnerable.

Few directs have been found, but we see that there is an interesting one. The directory **cgi-bin** is an interface (Common Gateway Interface) that enables a regular user to execute an external program on the web server. We can now list if there is some program in the server by using *dirb* specifying different file extensions.

### Blitz-eskalation

With the scan, file **user.sh** in directory **cgi-bin** has been discovered. As this is a Shell Script (SH) file, we can use the [Shellshok](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2014-6271) vulnerability to execute remote code on the machine, because the web server will copy certain information from the requests and the script will process it as an environment variable. 

To make things quicker and easier, as we mentioned at the beginning, we are going to use the *metasploit framework* to obtain the first foothold of our attack. *Metasploit* allows us to search for certain words that match some modules, in our case we search for **shellshok** and see that there is a module that uses **mod_cgi** to execute code on an **Apache** server.

We only have to select the *metasploit* module and configure it with the following parameters:
- The host where the web server is running (RHOST) and the port in case it is not the default (RPORT)
- The URL of the shell script file we found above (TARGETURI)
- The payload we are going to use (PAYLOAD) in our case a TCP reverse shell, but we could use other methods such as a web shell
- The host (LHOST) and port (LPORT) where the reverse shell will connect

Once exploited we see how we get a reverse shell and a new meterpreter session is opened. We can enter this session and open an interactive shell to see which user we have permissions.

At this point we would be interested in getting a better way of persistence than the reverse shell, such as using the SSH service, but in this case we are going to start enumerating in order to escalate privileges.

**Bingo!** Listing the commands allowed with *sudo*, we see that there is a particular binary that we can run as root without using a password. With a quick Google or [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/perl/) search, we found that `perl -e 'exec "/bin/sh";'` can be used to open a new shell with the permissions of the user who executed it.
