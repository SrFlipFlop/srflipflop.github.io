In this machine we are going to see a case that we could find in a real pentetration testing exercise. It teaches us that it is important to do a good enumeration and to know different key tools to achieve remote code execution.

### Information gathering

As always we will start with nmap to list the services running on the machine. We can see that there is only one web application running on port **8080** and that with the default NSE scripts `http-title` and `http-server-header`, the server is a *Tomcat 7.0.88*.

We continue with the usual procedure and we are going to launch a tool to enumerate the directories while analyzing the web application manually.

The Tomcat application has an administration panel to manage the web server. As we can see in the following images, we use *Basic Authentication* with default credentials but we have no luck and we are redirected to a page indicating that we have no privileges.

### Gaining foothold

In the error page, we can see that we are shown other default credentials (which in this case are the correct ones), but we are going to use another tool to make a brute force attack pretending that we have no knowledge of those credentials.

We can use *Hydra* as it is the most popular tool for this kind of attacks, but I want to try the *metasploit* `tomcat_mgr_login` module. This module is designed for these cases and already provides a dictionary with the most common credentials for Tomcat. As we have said before, we can see that the credentials of this server are: **tomcat:s3cret**.

Once inside Tomcat Web Application Manager we can upload a WAR (Web Application Resource) file to achieve remote code execution. This type of files are used to distribute web applications developed in Java and all its components (such as JAR files, JavaServer Pages, Java Servlets, Java classes, XML files, tag libraries, static web pages, etc.).

We are going to create a web shell with *JavaServer Pages* that connects to our machine once we access the resource. For this we will use *msfvenom* indicating the payload `jsp_shell_reverse_tcp`, the parameters with our IP and the type of final file. 

To see the name of the shell we have created we use *jar* to “unpack” the WAR file and see the name of the JSP resource (**hyjlabdochnq.jsp**).

We upload the file and wait for the response from the server to see if the format is correct. In the following images we see that the answer is successful and now we only need to activate the resource.

To use our reverse shell we only have to use *nc* to open the indicated port on our machine waiting for the connection and make a request to the resource we have uploaded previously, in this case on the `/shell/hyjlabdochnq.jsp` path.

### Analyzing the remote machine

We see that the reverse shell has elevated **system** permissions and proceed to find where the files with the flags can be found. For that we look in the Administrator directory for all the TXT files.

Inside the desktop you will find the flags folder that contains the file with the user and root flags.
