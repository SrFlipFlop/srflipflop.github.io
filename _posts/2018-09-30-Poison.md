This machine is a mix between real example and CTF. It allows us to solve some puzzles and learn how to connect to internal services from the attacker's machine.

### Information gathering

It has become a tradition to start using an **nmap** to analyze the services of the machine. We can see in the output that there are the typical SSH and HTTP service and this time we found VNC server.

The website contains a list of PHP scripts that extract technical information from the machine. This information could be useful to search some vulnerabilitis related to the software running or the OS.

### First step to the machine

But if we take a closer look to the *listfiles.php* output, it shows one more file that is not listed in the web page. This file contains a message saying that the content is encoded 13 times to protect the password.

With **ipython** we can decode easyly the content of the password in Base64.

Cool, now that we have a password we need to search for a valid user. The web *browse.php* functionallity it also allows to read local files (LFI), with this vulnerability we can extract the list of all users reading the */etc/passwd* file.

### Privilege escalation

Now that we have a SSH shell for the *charix* user, we need to find a way to elevate privileges. Searching files in the home directory, we find the suspicious *secret.zip* file. The machine have **nc** binary, we can use it to send the file to our machine.

This file is protected with the same password that we used for the SSH. The content does not give us much information but better keep in mind for the future.

Using the **LinEnum.sh** tool, no path has been found to elevate privileges. We know that this tool makes a very complete report of the system and I am sure that something has been overlooked.

One thing that called a lot of attention from the beginning was a VNC process that was being executed by the root user. When trying to connect to the service (which also appeared in **nmap**) it asked for a password that we didn't know, so it was necessary to look for more information in the machine to discover that password.

Looking for more information about VNC at the end we discovered that there is a file in the user's home (very similar to the *secret*). Using the following [script](https://github.com/jeroennijhof/vncpwd) we could connect to the VNC service, but only with user permissions. We also discovered that the *secret* was actually another VNC password (probably from the service that was running as root).

When looking for more information about the VNC process that was run as root, we could see that you could not see the complete command. Maybe the root VNC is running as a local service. Finally with **netstat** we can see that there is a VNC service running int the 127.0.0.1 address.

The next challange is to connect from our machine to the private service. To do this we can create a tunnel with **SSH** that connects one local port from our machine to the private service in the remote machine. With *-L* command SSH will open the port *1234* in our machine and connect directly to the private service with the port *5901*. To test if the tunnel is created correctly we can check with **netstat** if the port *1234* is available in our machine. Finally we only need to connect through the tunnel using **vncviewer** with the secret password and a VNC session with *root* permissions appear.
