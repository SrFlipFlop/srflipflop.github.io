To finish the series, today we are going to make the last Kioptrix machine. In this machine we are going to focus a lot on the database and some surprises to complicate things.

### Information gathering

As always we are going to start with *nmap* to see the remote services that we can find in the machine. Apart from the typical web application, we can see that we have open the **139** and **445** port for **SMB**.

The Server Message Block Protocol is a protocol widely used to share files between different systems, servers, ... Using different *NSE* (*Nmap Scripting Engine*) scripts, we can try to enumerate shared folders or users of the machine. We see that there are two shared passwords and that it has found 5 valid users by brute force.

While we investigate SMB, let's take the opportunity to list directories in the web application in case we find any interesting path.

We will also evaluate the web application manually while running the other tools. We see that the web page is a LigGoat login, we can try some default credentials but we are not able to authenticate.

Using the same login request we are going to use the classic SQL injection `' or '1'='` payload to see if we can bypass the authentication mechanisms without a correct password.

We have not been able to bypass the authentication, but we can see that somehow we have managed to insert part of our payload because the error message is different from the login failed message.

With sqlmap we are going to use the same request indicating the password field for the injection and using the dump option we are going to extract the information we find in the database. Bingo! We found two users, one with the password in clear text and the other seems to be encoded in Base64.

### First step

Following the information we have found, we are going to use john's credentials to log in via SSH. First of all we find a **“Welcome to LigGoat Security Systems - We are Watching”** message and what seems to be the commands we can use. When we try to do some enumeration, we see that the SSH connection closes.

Investigating a little more we see that we are in a restricted command environment in which we cannot do many actions without being kicked out. Finally, with the command `? help` we see that the environment in which we are is *lshell*.

![](/images/posts/Kioptrix4/img10.png "Limited shell")

Searching in [Exploit DB](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/39632) for the shell we have found, we see that there is an exploit that allows Remote Code Execution. When testing the Python script we see that it asks for the user, password and IP of the remote machine. When we run it again with the requested information, we get a pseudo-shell in which we can execute any command.

The environment we have obtained is not very comfortable, so let's see what the exploit does. Analyzing the python code, we see that with the `echo` command it manages to import a python library to execute commands.

To get a better shell like bash, let's connect directly with SSH and use the same trick as the exploit to execute commands in a more comfortable way. We execute the command `echo os.system('/bin/bash')` and voilà, we have a common shell to continue playing.

### Privilege escalation

Now that we have a normal environment, we can continue with the enumeration of the machine in order to elevate privileges. Analyzing the services, we find an interesting one that is running with administrator permissions.

We just need to find the database credentials, to take a step closer to scaling privileges.  Let's see if the application code with which we have dumpeted the users has the database credentials. We quickly found the **checklogin.php** file that seems to be suspicious of having such information. Surprise surprise, the database uses the root user directly and has no password so we could have logged in directly.

![](/images/posts/Kioptrix4/img15.png "Database credentials")

Depending on the database technology, there are several ways to execute code with SQL commands. In this case we will look in the **mysql** database and see the table **func** of allowed functions.

![](/images/posts/Kioptrix4/img16.png "List MySQL database")

Perfect! With the **sys_exec** function we can execute any command with elevated database privileges. In this case we are going to do the test by executing id and saving the results in a file.

There are many techniques for gaining persistence with elevated privileges, but to keep things simple let's add the user we already know to the **sudoers** file so that we can run any command as root.
