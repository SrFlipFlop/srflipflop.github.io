Continuing with the Kioptrix saga, this time we are going to face a machine very focused on web pentesting that can lead us into a dead end

### Information gathering

To continue our tradition, we will start by launching *nmap* to list the services and then different tools for each of those discovered services.

This time we found only two open ports with an **SSH server** and a **web application**, so let's start with the second one to see if it contains any vulnerabilities or configuration flaws.

Launching *nikto* we see interesting information and some curious directories, but to be on the safe side we will list the directories with *goubuster* while analyzing the web page manually.

### Quick win

In the web application we don't see much, just an administrator login panel. Trying various combinations of credentials we do not get access, so we are going to opt for another way.

The same login page indicates that the **LotusCMS** content management system has been used. Searching in [ExploitDB](https://www.exploit-db.com/) we found multiple vulnerabilities that allow remote code execution.

To avoid complications, we are going to use directly the *metasploit* `multi/http/lcms_php_exec` module that allows us to obtain a reverse shell of meterpreter. <del>It was easy, wasn't it?</del>

### Try harder!

Browsing through the gobuster results, we see that there is another directory that leads to another login panel. We try again different credentials, but they don't work so we are going to look if the service has some vulnerability.

As in the previous case, the login page itself contains information about the technology used. We can see that in [ExploitDB](https://www.exploit-db.com/) there are different types of web vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting, authentication and authoritzation bypass, ... But the most interesting one is a SQL injection that allows to extract the administrator credentials.

In the following image we can see how the administrator password is displayed in the gallery in clear text. With this information we can enter the web application and continue searching for vulnerabilities.

Another option is to continue using SQL injection, to see what sensitive information we can extract. With *sqlmap* we can enumerate the tables in the database and see that a suspicious table called `dev_accounts` is found.

Now we can extract all the entries from this table. I was surprised that *sqlmap* also supports cracking passwords using a deictionary attack. The following users have been found:
- dreg:Mast3r
- loneferret:starwars

### Privilege escalation

We are going to use one of the users extracted from the database, to access via SSH and continue attacking the machine from the inside.

![](/images/posts/Kioptrix3/img14.png "SSH login")

A classic way to elevate privileges in Linux is to use sudo, so let's list what options that user has. One of the two entries is a text editor that I didn't know before.

![](/images/posts/Kioptrix3/img15.png "sudo enumeration")

![](/images/posts/Kioptrix3/img16.png "sudoers file")

By being able to run a text editor with administrator privileges, we can edit any important system file to gain elevated privileges. Since we have used sudo, we will directly modify the sudoers file so that our current user can run any command as root with the following modification `loneferret ALL=NOPASSWD: ALL`.

![](/images/posts/Kioptrix3/img17.png "modify sudoers file")

To finish we only have to use `sudo su` to change to root user and obtain elevated privileges.
