<del>Again</del> Hello World! 

It's been a while since I've posted anything here and I think it's time to come back. Instead of being an *ego-related* blog, <del>like many people who are just starting out and want to prove their worth</del>, I think this time I'm going to focus more on personal projects to tell what I'm learning and what errors I'm facing (not to repeat them in the future).

I'm also going to change the publication rhythm, since that was one of the burnout reasons, and not force myself to post if the project I'm working on doesn't seem interesting enough. In the end, like many people in the cybersecurity world, we learn not to become “obsessed” with certain themes (although sometimes it's difficult) and to better manage burnout.

Best regards!
