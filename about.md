### About me

Hi, my nikname is SrFlipFlop and I’m currently working as a security consultant in Barcelona. It’s been 2 years since I start this journey of learning in the computer security world, and what I like most about it, is that you have to ryecicle your knowledges everyday.

These continuous learning, lead me to always think about new projects related to computer security or other fields like game/applications/tools development or do some research with new technologies. As you can imagine, my TODO list is always growing and it's difficult to make all the projects with only the after work time.
