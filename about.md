### About me

Hi, my nikname is SrFlipFlop and Iâ€™m currently working as a security engineer. It's been a few years since I started this journey in the world of cybersecurity and what I like the most is that there are always new things to learn.

Besides cybersecurity I really like the feeling when you are developing a new project, that I will most likely use less than I expected (but I've learned that I do it for that feeling of solving the puzzle). This often causes me to have *"shooting"* ideas that increase my TODO list at eternum.
