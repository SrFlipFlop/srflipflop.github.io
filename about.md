### About me

Hi, my nikname is SrFlipFlop and I’m currently working as a security consultant in Barcelona. It’s been 2 years since I start this journey of learning in the computer security world, and what I like most about it, is that you have to ryecicle your knowledges everyday.

These continuous learning, lead me to always think about new projects related to computer security or other fields like game/applications/tools development or do some research with new technologies. As you can imagine, my TODO list is always growing and it's difficult to make all the projects with only the after work time.

### Blog content

The content you'll see here is the realization of my unlimited TODO list. Some examples could be:
>* Different CTFs / War games to practice with new technologies.
>* Development of tools that automatize some boring things.
>* Some ideas related to game development.
>* Crackmes that I use to learn reversing in different architectures.
>* Maybe analyze Android malware.
>* Other crazy stuff related to IoT, hardware hacking, AI, robotics / domotics, ...

Basically I will try to put in this blog all the new things that I want to learn, and I hope it will serve to solve some doubts to other people or gain the motivation to start new projects.
