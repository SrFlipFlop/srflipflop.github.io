### Information gathering

As allways we start by enumerating the services running in the remote machine with **nmap**. The services found in the machine are little bit strange, there is a *finger* service at the port 79 and an *ssh* service at 22022.

Using the *finger* protocol we can enumerate users running in the remote machine. We can see that there are 4 different users found in the machine: **sammy, sunny, root and touhid**.

### Drastic measures

We are in a dead end because we don't have more services to enter in the remote machine. With the enumerated users we can try to bruteforce the *ssh* service using **hydra**.

Finalmente obtenemos la password sunday del usuario sunny (actually it was not necessary to make brute force with hydra, just try the name of the machine). Now we only have to try this password to access in the machine.

### TODO

A common method to elevate/change the privileges consist in finding unusual or misconfigured files and use these flaws to change your privileges. **find** is a tool that allows us to make advanced searches on the file system. In this case we use the *perm* option to search files with read and write privileges (644).

The last file found by **find** is a backup of the *shadow* file. In these file we can see the hash of the *sammy* and *sunny* users. Now with these information we can try to bruteforce the *sammy* password hash.

The first step to brute force consist of merging the content of *shadow* with that of *passwd*.

In the second step we only use **john the ripper** with the wordlist rockyou and the generated file in the first step. In a few seconds
